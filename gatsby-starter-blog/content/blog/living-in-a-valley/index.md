This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I grew up in a suburb outside of Dallas, Texas. Surrounded by flat, nothingness. I moved in Utah in 2012 to pursue School and enjoy the outdoors more. Being surrounded by mountains is a whole new world! You can tell North from West, and East from South. You can watch the sun rise and set behind them, casting the most gorgeous colors all about. 

Whenever I visit Texas, I think "I miss living in a valley..."
